# Feed Forward Neural Network Using Pytorch

This is the repository explaining create FFN using pytorch which I have created while learning.

In this repository I have explained following:

1. Generating dataset using make_blobs function in scikit-learn and it's visualization.
2. Using torch tensors and autograd.
3. Using inbuild NN.Functions.
4. Using NN.Parameter which wraps the parameters we generated.
5. Using NN.Linear and Optim,
   where Linear initialize the weights and biases by its own and optim privides the optimization functions like SGD, RMPProp, Adam etc.
6. Using NN.Sequential using which we can spacify the functionalities in sequence so that pytorch will execute them for us.
7. Running all above implementation on GPU.

I explained all above methodologues in comments in respective cells do check them.
